# Implementing-Multiple-Linear-Regression
Recently, I finished Andrew Ng's introductory course on machine learning and wanted to apply multiple linear regression to a dataset with python and the scikit-learn library. I mainly wanted to focus on implementing the model so I chose a clean dataset with little pre-processing to do. Ultimately, the model had a very poor predictive power which I am to fix in the future, either with this dataset or future datasets. 

Improvements I want to make are through: better preprocessing of the data, improved feature selection and testing out different regression models.
